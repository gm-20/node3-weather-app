Objective:
This is a Weather app which takes location from the user and provide temperature and rain probability of the location.

Backend:

Used express server to setup web environment.
Used hbs library to setup handlebars(Used for dynamic templating).
Used request library for asynchronous http request.

Synchronous: A synchronous request blocks the client until operation completes. In such case, javascript engine of the browser is blocked.

Asynchronous An asynchronous request doesnâ€™t block the client i.e. browser is responsive. At that time, user can perform another operations also.
In such case, javascript engine of the browser is not blocked.


Used 2 API's:
Mapbox --> It takes location and provide the respective coordinates of that place.
Darknet --> It takes coordinates and provide the temperature and rain probability of that place.

Called both API's with callback in order to have a non-blocking execution.


Frontend:


Used handlebars to make the pages dynamic.
Setup partial views to use them in other templates.

Used fetch HTTP request to take request from frontend to backend routes.


Git and SSH:

Generated SSH keys for secure connection between local computer and 3rd party server.(Using Git Bash)
--> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "rock.gm.9755@gmail.com"
--> eval $(ssh-agent -s)
--> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Setup the generated SSH key in github and heroku.

Setup git-scm for version control.

Setup git locally
--> git init
--> git status
--> Make .gitignore file and put the files whose tracking not required. for example node_modules
--> Initially all are untracked files
--> To move to staged set --> git add .
--> To move to commited stage --> git commit -m "First Init"



Used github repo : https://github.com/gm-20/node3-weather-app to store code in github.

To push local changes to github:
--> git remote add origin https://github.com/gm-20/node3-weather-app
--> ssh -T git@github.com
--> git push -u origin master


Deployment:

--> heroku login
--> heroku keys:add

--> heroku create app_name

--> Changes to package.json
    "scripts": {
    "start" : "node src/app.js",
    "dev" : "nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs"
    }

--> Change port  --> port = process.env.PORT

--> git push heroku master
